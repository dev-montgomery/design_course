            <h1>Leviathan (Livyatan)</h1>
            <p>
              The Leviathan is a sea serpent noted in theology and mythology. The Biblical Leviathan is often an embodiment of chaos and threatening to eat the damned after their life. Christian theologians identified Leviathan with the demon of the deadly sin envy, and according to Ophite diagrams, the Leviathan encapsulates the space of the material world. Some 19th-century scholars pragmatically interpreted it as referring to large aquatic creatures, but it would later come to be used as a term for sea monsters in general.

            <h1>Golden Dragon</h1>
            <p>
              In Chinese culture, the Golden Dragon is regarded as an omnipotent sun deity or god of the harvest. The Golden Dragon is considered to be an extremely benevolent deity and its arrival or presence is said to bring great prosperity to the land. One of the most well-known dragon myths in China is related to the dragon pearl. It is said that all dragons hold a pearl, usually its throat which holds the immense power that helps in ascending to heaven.

            <h1>Ryũ, Japanese Dragon</h1>
            <p>
              The Japanese Dragon is known as one of the Guardians of Buddhism. It is a snake-like creature covered in scales but without wings. Its appearance resembles a culmination of several animals, with a reptile body, eagle talons, a hairy camel's head, ox ears, and deer horns. Their demonic eyes add further grip to their fierce look, and unlike its Chinese relative, the Japanese Dragon only has three claws instead of five. The Japanese Dragon remains a symbol of strength and power, both highly respected and honored in Japanese society.

            <h1>Qinglong, The Azure Dragon</h1>
            <p>
              Qinglong is one of the Dragon Gods who represent the mount or chthonic forces of the Five Reagions' Highest Deities, and ruler of the East Blue. Its scales shimmer in various shades of blue representing its connection to the heavens and water. Considered a benevolent and protective creature, Qinglong is often associated with positive attributes, prosperity, and good fortune warding off negative forces.
